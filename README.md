# django-demo-app
This demo is dockerized, so if you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker), here is a magical one liner to get you up and running

`make build && make up`

#### Voil√†

If you don't already have docker, just go get [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker), even if you don't want to run the demo just go get it right now and thank me later.
